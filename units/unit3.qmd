## ðŸ“– Lecture

This week in class we discuss R lists, which are the most generic kind of data container in R. You will learn:

- in what sense a list is a non-atomic atomic
- in what sense a list is a one-dimensional object
- how to create lists
- practice manipulating lists
 


## ðŸ“š Reading

Read chapters 6, 7 and 8 of "R Coding Basics":

- <https://www.gastonsanchez.com/R-coding-basics/matrices2.html>
- <https://www.gastonsanchez.com/R-coding-basics/lists.html>
 


## ðŸ”¬ Lab

In addition to lists, in lab you will also learn about matrices in R. You will work creating and manipulating more atomic objects such as matrices, and also non-atomic lists.

 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Create simple matrices with `matrix()`
- Describe and give examples of matrix subsetting (subscripting, indexing)
- Explain in what sense a matrix is a 2-dimensional object
- Describe and give examples of subsetting (subscripting, indexing) of an R list
- Provide an example of list subsetting with single brackets (e.g. `lis[index]`)
- Provide an example of list subsetting with double brackets, and a single element (e.g. `lis[[index]]`) 
- Provide a manipulation example of a list with the dollar operator (e.g. `lis$wagon` )
