## ðŸ“– Lecture

Welcome to Stat 133. Our first meeting is on Wednesday Jan-17 where we begin with the usual review of the course policies, logistics, overall expectations, topics in a nutshell, etc. As for Friday Jan-19, we review some housekeeping aspects of R and RStudio to get you up and running for the following week.

 

## ðŸ”¬ Lab

Getting started with R and RStudio: first, we want to make sure everybody has installed both programs; and then we will provide an introductory review of RStudioâ€™s workspace, as well as a brief intro to Quarto notebooks. BTW: there's nothing to submit this week.
