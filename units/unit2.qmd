## ðŸ“– Lecture

This week we describe data types and their implementation as vectors in R (the most fundamental data object in R). We'll focus on important concepts like:

- main __data types__ ("atomic types" in R): logical, integer, real, and character

- __creation of vectors__

- __implicit coercion__ rules: what R does when you combine values of different data types

- __vectorization__: when R applies calculations or operations to all the elements of a vector (element-wise)

- __recycling__: what R does when you perform a calculation with vectors of different length

- __subsetting__ (aka subscripting, subindexing, indexing): the use of single/double brackets to subset (i.e. subscript, index) elements of a vector



## ðŸ“š Reading

Read the chapters that form Part I of "R Coding Basics":

## ðŸ”¬ Lab

You'll practice creating vectors in R, and learning about the concepts described above.

 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Describe the four common data types in R, and give examples for them
- Explain why R vectors are said to be atomic objects
- Describe and give an example of the implicit coercion rules
- Describe and give an example of vectorized code
- Describe and give an example of the recycling rule
- Describe and give an example of subsetting (indexing) vectors
 


## ðŸ”” Activities

HW1 instructions will be released at the end of this week.
